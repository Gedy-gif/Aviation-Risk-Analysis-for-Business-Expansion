# Business Understanding
The Aviation industry presents complex risks that require data driven insights before decision making.
The analysis leverages on the National Transportation Safety Board's Aviation data set(1962-2023) to evaluate risk patterns and guide on recommendations in the Aviation sector.
Parameters included are Weather conditions, Phase of flight, Type of Aircrafts, Accidents, engine models and aircraft make.

# Data Processing
I did data pre-processing, Cleaning and manipulation before comprehensive data analysis. This helped in drawing comprehensive insights and recommendations on how to handle possible risks and to help in avoiding them.
The data was obtained from Kaggle that was provided by National Transport Safety Board Aviation data 1962-2023. 
The data was loaded into Jupiter file, cleaned column names,fixed date format, removed columns with many missing data, imputed important columns such as weather conditions, accident fatalities and make. Prepared a clean data set and imported it.

# Business Goal
The business aims at:
# 1.Risk Profiling:
This would be helpful to Quantify how factors like weather instrumentation, engine count, and flight purpose correlate with accident likelihood and severity to prioritize safer aircraft models.

# 2.Understanding the trends hence need for proper Trend Analysis
Identify historical patterns in accidents such as  major causes, geographic hotspots to avoid high-risk operational conditions.


# 3.Obtaining Actionable Recommendations:
We will Provide evidence-based guidance for selecting low-risk aircraft and optimizing operational protocols.


# Questions to Address:
1. Has the number of accidents decreased over time due to technological or regulatory improvements?
Preliminary EDA reveals a peak in accidents around 1980–1990, followed by a steady decline, suggesting improved safety measures in recent decades.
2. Which locations had many accidents?
3. Which is the safest Make and Model of aircraft?
4. Do Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) contribute to accidents compared to Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC)?

# Key Findings
Aircraft accidents before 1980 were extremely minimal, suggesting both very few accidents occurred during this time or that data collection and record-keeping systems were either weak or non-existent. Accurate accident reporting likely gained momentum post-1980 when aviation oversight improved globally.

Starting from 1980, there was a sharp rise in the number of recorded aircraft accidents, reaching a peak shortly afterward. However, from the early 1980s to 2020, we observe a steady and significant decline in accident numbers, reducing to approximately 1,600 by 2020. This sharp and consistent decrease strongly suggests major improvements in aviation safety over time. While multiple factors could contribute to this positive trend, one notable driver has been technological advancement, from better navigation systems, automated control systems, to stricter maintenance and operational standards.

The historical accident data show that personal-use and instructional aircraft have the highest accident rates. In contrast, public/commercial aircraft experience significantly fewer accidents. This suggests that operations under strict regulatory environments, professional maintenance schedules and with highly trained pilots have lower risks.

When we examine country-level accident distribution, the United States stands out significantly with the highest number of aircraft accidents compared to other countries, which reported relatively lower numbers. This could be explained by the much larger number of aircraft movements, a vast network of private pilots, and the widespread use of personal aircraft in the U.S. compared to other nations.


Further analysis into flight operation conditions reveals that accidents were more rampant when pilots operated under Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) — that is, flying based on visual reference rather than relying on instruments. In contrast, accidents that occurred under Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) were significantly fewer. This finding suggests that reliance on visual cues, possibly in adverse or misleading conditions, increases the risk of accidents, highlighting the importance of strong instrument training and certification for pilots.

When considering the extent of damage, accidents under VMC often resulted in substantial aircraft damage or destruction. In comparison, incidents under IMC conditions were less severe in terms of aircraft damage. This could indicate that pilots operating in IMC are more likely to adhere to strict operational procedures, or it could point to the effectiveness of instruments and structured flight paths under such conditions.

Additionally, training aircraft are naturally prone to higher accident risks due to the nature of flight training — student pilots practicing maneuvers, frequent takeoffs and landing. However, the high accident rate among personal-use aircraft is more concerning. It hints at deeper systemic issues such as poor maintenance routines, less formal pilot training, old aircrafts and potentially less attention towards flight safety. Commercial flights are much safer due to strict safety measures, proper personnel training, well maintained aircrafts, new technology systems.

All the Models of Cessna are prone to accidents and have the highest number of accidents since 1981. The company needs to be careful when purchasing any model of Cessna. Piper PA-28-140 is also prone to accident and has a higher number of accidents compared to Cessna 50 which has fewer accidents.

Its also noted that most accidents occur during landing, takeoff and issues concerning with cruise. This raises a concern of measures put in place at the airport during landing like visibility of runway, proper direction and capability of the aircrafts to handle the weight and goods they are carrying.

# Key Recommendations
1. The company should consider purchasing either Fairchild or Zwicker Murray R.The company needs to be careful when purchasing any model of Cessna.
2. The company should heavily invest in Instruments Metereological Conditions Tools and encourage their pilots to always use IMC as opposed to VMC
3. The company should adapt new technology systems to help in navigation. This in turn will reduce number of accidents.
4. There is need to have a proper control of aircrafts during takeoff and landing. With proper training of personnels we can be able to handle and control accidents occurence.
